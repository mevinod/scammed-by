## Background
I was getting a lot of ads related to pages selling crocs clogs in Instagram. Thought of giving a try.
## What happened: 
There was a page showed up `keepwix`. They sold it for 899. I sent a message to their whatsapp. It was Indian number (xxxx). They didn't reply iniitally and I sent a message after couple of hours. I got a reply, he told the size and color available. I asked for COD. He told 100 advance pay. Once I paid, he immediately called and told 86 courier charge since I am not from delhi. I paid that too. After 1 day or so, I asked for courier details and he gave a tracking ID. After few days - when I tried to contact them, they had a UK whatsapp number. Boom. And I got the courier in next few days. I paid the rest COD amount and as soon I opened, I knew I am screwed. It was some local unbranded clogs with half the size of what I wear. 

Should have considered:
1. Check the instagram account. The comments.
2. Should have asked for a photo during packing

Initial Instagram account: keepwix
Later they were unavailable for few weeks then changed to some other names and currently its `new-name`
