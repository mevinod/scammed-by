## What happened?
I got a used scooter from someone for my wife. They gave all papers signed. I could have done it online, but they did not have adhar or phone linked with the RC. So, I went to RTO office. As soon I parked the scooter - a person came and told he will get it all done in 15 days. I gave the papers on March 22 but its yet to be done.




## Some lies he told
1. For a month and more he told about General election and counting
2. He told about Bangalore rain and waterlogging
3. He told Inspector unwell.
4. He told its already dispatched
