## Background
We had moved from Karike (in Coorg) to Kanhirapoil near Kanhangad. I was in Bangalore and used to visit home sometimes. I used to rent his car for a day or two when at home to go around relatives homes.
## What happened?
One fine Monday? morning he called and told - he's in a car showroom to get delivery of a new vehicle but have some amount shortage - which his friend supposed to return but have not.

# Indication I missed
- That was a bit less amount. No showroom will hold off for that amount.
- He got amount in two transaction/twice. Should have stopped in the 2nd time atleast.
